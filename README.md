- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript - MDN Webdocs  


### What I learned

I learned to write JavaScript as a calculator, I could understand better the ".innerHTML" element, as well as the "queryselectors". This challenge was very good so I could practice and learn more about JavaScript basics and fundamentals to improve my knowledge.
